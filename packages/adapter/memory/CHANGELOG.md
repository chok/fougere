### Minor Changes

- 8f390d0: A place rows live is a `Source`, and what realizes it is named in the config.

  **Four gestures, and the absence answers.** A `Source` states `storageFactory` (required),
  `migrate?`, `transacted?` and `close?`. What it is MADE OF is not there: `adapter/sql` keeps
  `dialect`, `db` and `sink` on its own `SqlSource`, reached by narrowing — the rule
  `Storage.client` already obeyed one level down. A source that hands out no transaction makes a
  `Together<[…]>` compensate instead of transacting, and the boot says which of the two it built,
  per frame.

  **The migration is the source's own gesture.** The router hands each source what lives there
  plus the names of what does not; a source knows its own engine. This fixes a real defect: every
  source was migrated as `'sqlite'`, the documented Postgres case included, because the router
  passed no dialect.

  **`source:` names the adapter.** `dialect` stays SQL's property, read by the only package that
  knows what it is worth — the shape `adapters:` already has on an entity. An adapter answers a
  name by registering at import, so nothing central lists them, and a name nothing answers is
  refused saying what this process does answer. The refusal "only `sqlite` resolves from a name"
  moved to `@fougere/adapter-sql`, where the reason is true.

  **Thirteen gestures from four.** `storageOver` derives the whole storage port from a `Rows`
  (`get`/`has`/`set`/`delete`/`all`/`client`). Measured on the Map realization: 14 lines of 140
  touched the store; the rest — pages, criteria, lifecycle stamps, the two refusals a `create`
  owes its caller — is the same wherever rows live. Writing a source is now four gestures, not
  thirteen.

  **Two new adapters.** `@fougere/adapter-memory` (rows in a Map, 37 lines, and the fallback an
  app with no `db` already ran on) and `@fougere/adapter-file` (one JSON per row, a directory per
  entity, `migrate` being a `mkdir`). They replace three divergent hand-written copies in the
  demos, each of which answered six of the thirteen gestures, forced the field name `id` and
  minted a uuid whatever the entity declared.

  **Renamed.** The cross-source reader a handler injects is `Reads`, not `Sources` — it is
  declared by `reads:` and reads over sources rather than being them. `ResolvedStorage.raw` and
  `.dialect` are gone: zero and one reader respectively.
